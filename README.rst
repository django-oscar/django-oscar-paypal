===============================
PayPal package for django-oscar
===============================

This package provides integration between django-oscar_ and both `PayPal
Express`_ and `PayPal Payflow Pro`_.

.. _django-oscar: https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar
.. _`PayPal Express`: https://www.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_additional-payment-ref-impl1
.. _`PayPal Payflow Pro`: https://merchant.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=merchant/payment_gateway

These payment options can be used individually or together.  Further, the
package is structured so that it can be used without Oscar if you so wish.
